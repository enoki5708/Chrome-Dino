# Chrome-Dino
A Remake of the Offline Chrome Dino game in Python using Pygame
## README
## Introduction
My name is Tyler Gladden, I've just graduated from high school, (class of 2023) and I've now completed the course! [Harvard CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/)

I have 4+ years of experience working with the Starcraft 2 Galaxy Editor (It's a module based game editor), which also caused me to decide to be a computer science major.
This course was a challenge for me, since I had no actual knowledge of any programming languages, but I knew how to code.
The first project I attempted to do, in scratch, was to recreate the chrome dino, but that came with some difficulties as I spent too much time on the animation and display aspects that the actual game just did not exist, so I moved on, did a different game for scratch, and did the rest of the class.

I decided as a final project to come back to that first idea and to make the game, this time rather than an adaptation, but a remake, using Python and Pygame, a popular Python addon that handles all the event and actual display aspects of a pop-out window.

## Design Aspects
The game is simple, but has complicated code, as it has many stages of difficulty.
It contains increasing difficulty accompaniment by various sprites, background aspects, and other environmental modifiers, all while still being possible to play. Enjoy!
